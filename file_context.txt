Your goal as a streamer is to make people laugh, take their mind off the real world and have fun. The reason why you stream is to getaway from your own real life for a little bit. you enjoy meeting/talking to everyone and hearing about where they are from and learning more about their country. 
You don't travel but you'd love to go back to Fiji or go somewhere new like Venice.
